        <h1>Contributing to Core</h1>

        <h1 id="!core-principles">Core Principles</h1>
        <p>
          This document is a <em>brief</em> overview of Core's coding
          standards.  For a longer and more detailed discussion of the
          motivation behind these standards, you can read
          this <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/28">blog
          post</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that Core is designed differently from INRIA's standard
          library, and so Core is not a drop-in replacement.  You will
          have to modify code that's designed against INRIA's stdlib
          to use Core.
        </p>

        <h2 id="!types-and-modules">Types and Modules</h2>

        <p>
          Almost all types should have the type-name <code>t</code>,
          and should be kept in a dedicated module.  This even extends
          to the built in types
          like <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>
          and <code>bool</code>, which have their own modules
          in <code>Core</code>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="!t-comes-first"><code>t</code> comes first</h2>

        <p>
          If you have a function in a module <code>M</code> that takes
          an argument of type <code>M.t</code>, then that argument
          goes first by default.
        </p>

        <h3 id="!error-handling-exceptions-options-and-function-names">Error handling: exceptions, options and function names</h3>

        <p>
          In most circumstances, a function should not routinely throw
          an exception unless it indicates so explicitly, either in
          the function name, by ending with <code>_exn</code>, or in
          the type of the return value, <em>e.g.</em>, using an
          option.  Thus, <code>List.find</code> returns an option
          rather than throwing <code>Not_found</code>,
          and <code>List.find_exn</code> throws an exception.
        </p>

        <p>
          Catching of individual exceptions is discouraged, and in
          many cases, individual exceptions are not exported from the
          modules in which they are defined.
        </p>

        <p>
          When using the type of the return value to model the error,
          consider the following forms:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <code>option</code>, when no information needs to be
            returned in the error case
          </li>
          <li>
            Use <code>'a Or_error.t</code>, when there is textual
            information to be returned in the error case.  (Note that
            this is the same as a <code>('a,Error.t) Result.t</code>.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a <code>Result.t</code> with a custom error type
            (often a polymorphic value) when specific error
            information needs to be handled programmatically.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Other forms (for example, an <code>('a,exn) Result.t</code>)
          do come up in Core, but are not the preferred mode.
        </p>

        <h2 id="!interface-includes">interface includes</h2>

        <p>
          There are a number of standardized interfaces that we use as
          components of lots of different signatures.  Thus, if you
          had a module representing a type that could be converted
          back and forth to floats, supported comparison and has its
          own hash function, you could write the interface as follows:
        </p>

        <pre class="sh_caml">
module M : sig
  type t
  include Floatable  with type t := t
  include Comparable with type t := t
  include Hashable   with type t := t
end
</pre>
