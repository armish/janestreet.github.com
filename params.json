We've made different design decisions, and so code designed for the standard library would need to be adapted in order to use Core.\r\n\r\nThe Core suite has the following components:\r\n\r\n* `Core`, which is the heart of the standard library\r\n* `Core_extended`, a set of extra, less carefully tested and reviewed but still useful libraries.\r\n* `Async`, a monadic concurrency library\r\n* A set of syntax extensions, including `sexplib` and `bin_prot`, which extend the OCaml language itself.   These are _not_ necessary to use the rest of the libraries, but they are necessary for building them.\r\n\r\nCore has been available for several years, but we've just moved to a new development model for our open-source libraries, and we hope this will make it easier to interact and accept patches from others.  We'll have new stable releases here soon, but for now, we just have the development tree hosted here.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nReleases of Core are available here:\r\n\r\n[https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/]()\r\n\r\n## Interested in contributing to Core?\r\n\r\nGreat!  We're happy to work with people who want to help grow Core and the associated libraries.  In order to contribute to Core, though, you need to sign the Core CLA (Contributor License Agreement).
