        <h1>Contributing to Core</h1>

        <p>
        Jane Street requires that all contributors of code or
        documentation to Jane Street's open-source libraries complete,
        sign, and submit
        an <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com/core-icla-1_1.pdf">Individual
        Contributor License Agremenet</a>.  The purpose of this
        agreement is to clearly define the terms under which
        intellectual property has been contributed to thereby allow us
        to defend the project should there be a legal dispute
        regarding the software, and to be flexible should licensing
        requirements change. A signed CLA must be on file before an
        individual's contributions will be accepted.
        </p>

        <p>
        Corporations that have assigned employees to work on Core
        should execute
        a <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com/core-ccla-1_1.pdf">Corporate
        Contributor License Agreement</a>.  covering intellectual
        property that may have been assigned as part of an employment
        agreement. Individuals working for corporations that have
        signed a CCLA still have to sign their own Individual CLA, to
        cover any of their contributions which are not owned by their
        employer.

        You can submit your CLA by:

        emailing a scan to <mailto:core-cla@janestreet.com>
        or sending a fax to 917-746-6597
        </p>

        <p>
          As a technical matter, here is the way of submitting to
          core:
          <ul>
            <li>
              create a pull-request for the project you want to
              contribute to (for
              example: <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/async">async</a>).
              The request will be used for discussion only, it won't be
              merged in the public repository in the end because this
              is not how we work internally.
            </li>
            <li>
              once the change is accepted we will integrated to our
              development/review process and it will be part of a
              future release of Core.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
