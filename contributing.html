        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>
        Jane Street requires that all contributors of code or
        documentation to Jane Street's open-source libraries complete,
        sign, and submit
        an <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com/core-icla-1_1.pdf">Individual
        Contributor License Agremenet</a>.  The purpose of this
        agreement is to clearly define the terms under which
        intellectual property has been contributed to thereby allow us
        to defend the project should there be a legal dispute
        regarding the software, and to be flexible should licensing
        requirements change. A signed CLA must be on file before an
        individual's contributions will be accepted.
        </p>

        <p>
        Corporations that have assigned employees to work on Core
        should execute
        a <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com/core-ccla-1_1.pdf">Corporate
        Contributor License Agreement</a>.  covering intellectual
        property that may have been assigned as part of an employment
        agreement. Individuals working for corporations that have
        signed a CCLA still have to sign their own Individual CLA, to
        cover any of their contributions which are not owned by their
        employer.

        You can submit your CLA by:

        emailing a scan to <mailto:core-cla@janestreet.com>
        or sending a fax to 917-746-6597
        </p>

        <h2>Submitting a patch</h2>

        <p> Once you've submitted a CLA, here's how you go about
        contributing a patch.
          <ul>
            <li>
              create a pull-request for the project you want to
              contribute to (for
              example: <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/async">async</a>).
              The request will be used for discution only, it won't be
              merged in the public repository in the end because this
              is not how we work internally.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure that your changes match
              our <a href="coding-standards.html">coding
              standards</a>.  Also, if you introduce any significant
              new functionality, you should make sure to include
              documentation and unit tests.  The unit tests should
              typically be done using the <b>pa_ounit</b> syntax
              extension.
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone at Jane Street will take responsibility for
              migrating the patch through our internal process, and
              communicating with you.  When review and testing is
              complete, the next release will include your change.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Release process</h2>

          Internally we have a weekly release cycle for our code, but
          we push those releases out publicly somewhat less often,
          typically once a month.

          The version numbers for all of our projects are
          synchronized, so when a release
