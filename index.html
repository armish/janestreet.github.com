        <h1>The Core Suite</h1>

        <p>
          The Core suite of libraries is an industrial strength
          alternative to OCaml's standard library that was developed
          by <a href="http://janestreet.com">Jane Street</a>, the
          largest industrial user of OCaml.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that Core is <em>not</em> a compatible, drop-in
          replacement for the standard library.  We've made different
          design decisions, and so code designed for the standard
          library would need to be adapted in order to use Core.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Core suite has the following components:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>Core</code>, which is the heart of the standard
            library
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Core_extended</code>, a set of extra, less carefully
            tested and reviewed but still useful libraries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Async</code>, a monadic concurrency library
          </li>
          <li>
            A set of syntax extensions, including <code>sexplib</code>
            and <code>bin_prot</code>, which extend the OCaml language
            itself.  These are <em>not</em> necessary to use the rest
            of the libraries, but they are necessary for building
            them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Core has been available for several years, but we've just
          moved to a new development model for our open-source
          libraries, and we hope this will make it easier to interact
          and accept patches from others.  We'll have new stable
          releases here soon, but for now, we just have the
          development tree hosted here.
        </p>
